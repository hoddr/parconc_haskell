Second time (with decent Haskell knowledge this time!) working through Parallel and Concurrent
Programming in Haskell (Marlow). Simply working through the book and some exercises.

As per book and web instructions, Arch install for `ThreadScope` worked via:

- pacman -S gtk2hs-buildtools
- cabal v2-update
- cabal v2-install threadscope
- (test) threadscope --test ch8

Took a bit but worked just fine.
